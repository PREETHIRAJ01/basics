code:
Chandru went for shopping and he was offered N number of items at various discount percentage rates.
Out of these N items he wants to choose N-1 items such that the amount he saves is maximum.
The program must print the item which is to be left out.Input Format:First line will contain the value of N - number of 
itemsN lines containing item name, label price and the discount percentage separated by one or more spaces.
Output Format:The name of the item which is not to be purchased as it offers least discount.
Boundary Conditions:2 <= N <= 20
The length of the item name string value is from 1 to 100.
The price of the item is from 1 to 999999
Example Input/Output 1:Input:
3
harddisk 4000 20
monitor 15000 10
laptop 30000 5
Output:harddisk
Explanation:harddisk savings = 800, monitor savings = 1500, laptop savings = 1500. 
Hence harddisk is offering least savings and is to be left out.
Max Execution Time Limit: 5000 millisecs


approach:
1.get the inputs as string,int and int
2.calculate the savings
3.if the savings is lesser than the minsavings
  assign savings to minsavings
  copy the string s(item) to temp
4.finally display the item which is in temp.


my code:
#include<stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include<string.h>
int main()
{
int n;
scanf("%d",&n);
char s[100]; 
char temp[100];
int amount,discount,minsavings=1000000,savings;
int i=0;
while(n--) 
{ 
while(scanf("%s\t%d\t%d",s,&amount,&discount)>0)

{ 
savings=(amount/100)*discount;
if(savings<minsavings) 
{ 
strcpy(temp,s);
minsavings=savings; 
} 
}
} 
printf("%s",temp);
}


code solution provided by skillrack:
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
int N;
scanf("%d",&N);
char itemName[100];
int price;
int discount;
int lowestDiscount=0;
char lowestDiscountItemName[100];
int counter=0;
while(counter < N)
{
scanf("%s%d%d",itemName,&price,&discount);
int currentItemDiscount = price * discount/100;
if(counter == 0)
{
lowestDiscount = currentItemDiscount;
strcpy(lowestDiscountItemName,itemName);} 
else 
{
if(currentItemDiscount < lowestDiscount)
{
lowestDiscount = currentItemDiscount;
strcpy(lowestDiscountItemName,itemName);
}
}
counter++;
}
//end of while
puts(lowestDiscountItemName);
}
