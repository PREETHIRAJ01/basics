Given the first 2 terms A and B of a Geometric Series. The task is to find the Nth term of the series.

Input:
First line contains an integer, the number of test cases 'T'. 
T testcases follow. Each test case in its first line contains two integer A and B (First 2 terms of GP). 
In the second line of every test case it contains of an integer N.

Output:
In each seperate line print the Nth term of the Geometric Progression.
Print the floor ( floor(2.3)=2 ) of the answer. Both the terms A and B forms a valid GP. 

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 30
-100 <= A <= 100
-100 <= B <= 100
1 <= N <= 5

Example:
Input:
2
2 3
1
1 2
2

Output:
2
2

Explanation:
Testcase 2: The second term of series whose common ratio is 2 will be 2.
 
NOTE:
Gp series is a, ar, ar2, ar3.. and so on
Nth term of gp is given by an=arn-1

ratio is given by r= (n+1)term/(n)term

TN=a*r^(n-1)
Floor of negative number : floor(-0.5) = -1

code:
#include <stdio.h>
#include<math.h>

int main() 
{
	int t;
	scanf("%d",&t);
	float a,b;
	int n;
	while(t--)
	{
	    scanf("%f%f\n%d",&a,&b,&n);
	    float r=(b/a);
	    float result=a*(pow(r,n-1));
	    printf("%.0f\n",floor(result));
	}
	return 0;
}
