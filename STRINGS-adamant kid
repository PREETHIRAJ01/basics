An adamant kid keeps on repeating the stuff he wants.
Like if the kid wants chocolate he keeps repeating "chocolate". 
Given the stuff the child is demanding the program must print if the character in two given positions X, Y is 
same or not by printing YES or NO.Input Format:First line will contain the name of the stuff as a string value S.
Second line will contain two integer values X, Y denoting the position of the characters. The values of X and Y are
separated by a space.Output Format:First line will contain YES or NOBoundary Conditions:Length of S is from 2 to 100.
Sample Input/Output:
Example 1:Input:
icecream
4 10
Output:YES
Explanation:As the kid keeps on repeating icecream, the 10th position character will also be c in icecreamicecream.
As the characters in 4th and 10th position are same (that is c) the output is YES
Example 2:Input:
cake
2 12
Output:NOExplanation:When cake is repeated like cakecakecakecake, the character in 12th position is e which is NOT equal 
to the character a in 2nd position. Hence the output is NO.
Max Execution Time Limit: 5000 millisecsC ( gcc 8.x)
my logic:
1.get the input from the user
2. just check whether n1 and n2 are lesser than or equal to string length(if it is thren no problem)
3. if it is greater than the length of the string
    just keep reducing the value of n1 and n2 from the string length
    until is lesser than or equal to the string length
    
    
    
#include<stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main()
{
char s[100];
scanf("%s",s);
int n1,n2;
scanf("%d%d",&n1,&n2);
int diff1=n1,diff2=n2;
while(diff1>strlen(s)) 
{
diff1=diff1-strlen(s);
}
while(diff2>strlen(s))
{ 
diff2=diff2-strlen(s); 
} 
if(s[diff1]==s[diff2])
{
printf("YES");
}
else if(s[diff1]!=s[diff2])
{
printf("NO"); 
}
}

or 
code2(skillrack solution)

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
char input[100];
scanf("%s",input);
int len = strlen(input);
int X,Y;
scanf("%d%d",&X,&Y);
int effectiveX, effectiveY;
//As the index starts from zero.
effectiveX = X-1;
effectiveY = Y-1;
if(effectiveX >= len)
{
effectiveX = effectiveX%len;
}
if(effectiveY >= len) 
{
effectiveY = effectiveY%len;
}
if(input[effectiveX] == input[effectiveY])
{
printf("YES");
}
else 
{
printf("NO");
}
}
