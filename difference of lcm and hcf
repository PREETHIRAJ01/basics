Two whole numbers N1 and N2 are passed as input. 
The program must print the difference between the LCM and HCF of these two numbers.Input Format:First line will contain the value of the first number N1Second line will contain the value of the second number N2Output Format:First line will contain the difference between the LCM and HCF of N1 and N2Boundary Conditions:1 <= N1 <= 999991 <= N2 <= 99999Sample Input/Output:Example 1:Input:3045Output:75Explanation:LCM is 90 and HCF is 15. 
Difference = 90-15 = 75Example 2:Input:100120Output:580Explanation:LCM is 600 and HCF is 20. Difference = 600-20 = 580


code1:
#include <stdio.h>
int findHCF(int N1, int N2)
{
int numerator, denominator, remainder; 
if(N1 > N2)
{
numerator = N1;
denominator = N2;
}
else
{
numerator = N2; 
denominator = N1;
}
remainder = numerator%denominator; 
while(remainder != 0) 
{
numerator = denominator;
denominator = remainder;
remainder = numerator%denominator;
} 
return denominator;
}
int main()
{
int x,y; 
scanf("%d%d",&x,&y); 
int HCF = findHCF(x,y); 
long LCM = (x*y)/HCF; 
printf("%ld",LCM-HCF);
}
