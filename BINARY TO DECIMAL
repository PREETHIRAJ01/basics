code 1:(without optimization)

CONSIDER 10000 WHICH IS 16 IN DECIMAL
2^4 IS 16
HERE FOR 16--->BINARY
               4 3 2 1 0
               1 0 0 0 0
I AM USING  COUNT TO GET THE BIT POSITION TO MAKE IT TO BE THE POWER OF 2
1. IN FIRST FIRST IF I AM CHECKING WHETHER R IS EQUAL TO 1
IF IT IS AM DOING 2^COUNT

2. IN SECOND IF IAM CHECKING WHETHER R IS EQUAL TO 0
IF IT IS AM JUST IGNORING AND CONTINUING BY GOING AGAIN TO TOP OF THE LOOP
                       



#include <stdio.h>
#include<math.h>

int main() 
{
	int t;
	scanf("%d",&t);
	int sum=0,count=0,n,r;
	while(t--)
	{
	    scanf("%d",&n);
	    while(n!=0)
	    {
	        r=n%10;
	        if(r==1)
	        {
	        sum=sum+pow(2,count);
	        count++;
	        n=n/10;
	        }
	        if(r==0)
	        {
	        n=n/10;
	        count++;
	        continue;
	        }
	        
	        
	    }
	    printf("%d\n",sum);
	    sum=0;
	    count=0;
	    
	    
	}
	return 0;
}
